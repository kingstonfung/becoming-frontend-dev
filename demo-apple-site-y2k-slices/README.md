This is a sample HTML project showing how frontend developers used to compose websites by taking Photoshop slices and converting them into individual images.

Then, we build `<table>` to house these images in their appropriate arrangements.

Although no one would be using this technique anymore, but the underlying lessons are still very applicable to modern day frontend development philosophies:

  - Breakdown the larger site (application) into smaller pieces (componnets)
  - Work on each pieces at a time (Back then: optimizing the images) (Today: craft individual components)
  - Arrange them so you can put together a compelling presentation for your viewers (users)
  - The higher level container (Back then: <body>) (Today: Component) would apply necessary linkage or hover states to individual elements (Components). And other data or infomration would trickle down into each elements.

This is not a "perfect" example, but close enough to demostrate the technique used back in the days.
